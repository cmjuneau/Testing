Comments:

Note that for the old (October) version of the code, the same results were used - no change was made to the program (from October) during this analysis

A "binary" search was performed to find the errors.  i.e. if there were only errors in one subroutine, the binary search will converge on the answer faster than a "bubble searcH" type of method.


1st Search: Split LAQ1.f into 2 files down the middle.
------------------------------------------------------
- 1st Half Original (2nd half different): No differences
- 2nd Half Original (1st half different): Numerical Differences
- When plotting, the 1st half different output was an order of magnitude lower.  No differences otherwise.

Conclusion: Issue lies in First half of LAQ1.f.  Divide this half into portions and test again.  Results Below.


2nd Search: Split the 1st Half of LAQ1.f into 2 files down the middle.
------------------------------------------------------
- 1st Quarter New (2nd Quarter Original): Numerical Differences
- 2nd Quarter New (1st Quarter Original): No Differences
- When Plotting, the New 1st Quarter output file had numerically lower values, while the New 2nd Quarter output file had the exact same data points as the October Version.

Conclusion: Issue lies in the first 1/4 of the LAQ1.f file.  Divide this portion in half and test again.  Results below.


3rd Search: Split LAQ1.f into 2 files down the middle.
------------------------------------------------------
- 1st Routine New (All rest Original): Numerical Differences
- 1st Routine Original (All rest New): No Differences
- When Plotting, the new first routine file had numerically lower values, while the version where the first routine is the original version matched perfectly.

Conclusion: Issue lies in the first routine of LAQ1.f file, POINTN.  Resolve issue by checking error protection additions, and test again.
