This file is a temporary file
to be used by the test script
to "fill" space.

In the test input, we want the
order of files to be:
(CEM)
(CEM-LAQ)
(LAQ)

This file, temp.inp, allows us
to keep this order easily.  We
want these files in the same
order so the MATLAB tool can
display these value IN ORDER,
otherwise the graphs produced
will not be able to have a legend
applied to them.
