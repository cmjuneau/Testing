Comments:

Note that for the old (October) version of the code, the same results were used - no change was made to the program (from October) during this analysis


LAQ1.f Differences:
--------------------------------------------
-Compared to LAQ2.f, the output files differ greatly; values are different, however closer together (numerically) than when compared to the October Version.
- No differences - only time
-


LAQ2.f Differences:
--------------------------------------------
- Numerically lower than other output files.
- When plotted, curve shape mostly follows that of the others, however is typically an order of magnitude lower.
-


Other Differences:
--------------------------------------------
- No differences - only time
- Differs greatly from LAQ2.f output
-

Plot Differences:
--------------------------------------------
-For all angles, LAQ2 is the only numerically different plot.  Data points are lower on curve, following the same shape.
-LAQ2 file is the only one that is numerically different when graphed.
-


RESULTS: Issue lies in LAQ2.f File somewhere.  Suggested seperate the file into portions due to large size and find differences that way.
